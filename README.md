# Inverted-Pendulum
This is an open-sourced project designed by Purdue Polytechnic engineering students. The inverted pendulum is a rotational single-arm pendulum using PID control theory and C++. 
The STL files, IDE sketch, assembly instructions, and purchase links can be found in the appropriate sections on this page. 

To complete this project you will need the following:
- Software: Arduino IDE and 3D printing slicer software for prints such as Creality Slicer
- Refer to the BOM document for a complete list of all materials required
- Access to a 3D printer with ABS filament
- Basic soldering skills

Once your inverted pendulum is fully assembled, you'll need to tune Kp, Ki, and Kd for your device. For steps on how to tune the PID variables refer to [DigiKey: How to Tune a PID Controller](https://www.digikey.com/en/maker/projects/how-to-tune-a-pid-controller/9ee9a111aef049af9f84f785779989ec).
